%
% Symbols permitted in metadata
% =============================
% 
% Within the metadata, all printable ASCII characters except
% '\', '{', '}', and '%' represent themselves. Also, all printable
% Unicode characters from the basic multilingual plane (i.e., up to
% code point U+FFFF) can be used directly with the UTF-8 encoding. 
% Consecutive whitespace characters are combined into a single
% space. Whitespace after a macro such as \copyright, \backslash, or
% \sep is ignored. Blank lines are not permitted. Moreover, the
% following markup can be used:
%
%  '\ '         - a literal space  (for example after a macro)                  
%   \%          - a literal '%'                                                 
%   \{          - a literal '{'                                                 
%   \}          - a literal '}'                                                 
%   \backslash  - a literal '\'                                                 
%   \copyright  - the (c) copyright symbol                                      
%
% The macro \sep is only permitted within \Author, \Keywords, and
% \Org.  It is used to separate multiple authors, keywords, etc.
% 
% List of supported metadata fields

%  \Copyrighted      - 'True' if the document is copyrighted, and
%                      'False' if it isn't. This is automatically set
%                      to 'True' if either \Copyright or \CopyrightURL
%                      is specified, but can be overridden. For
%                      example, if the copyright statement is "Public
%                      Domain", this should be set to 'False'.
%
% Publication information:
%
% \PublicationType   - The type of publication. If defined, must be
%                      one of book, catalog, feed, journal, magazine,

%                      automatically set to "journal" if \Journaltitle
%                      is specified, but can be overridden.
% \Journaltitle      - The title of the journal in which the document
%                      was published. 
% \Journalnumber     - The ISSN for the publication in which the

% \Lastpage          - Last page number of the published version of
%                      the document.
% \Doi               - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the
%                      document, without the leading "doi:".
% \CoverDisplayDate  - Date on the cover of the journal issue, as a
%                      human-readable text string.

\Subject      {Recent studies demonstrate the significant practical value of hybrid queries, which integrate vector search with structured filters (e.g., attribute and range filtering) for refined retrieval.
		However, current evaluations lack unified benchmarking standards and systematic assessment methodologies. Existing studies either fail to cover mainstream algorithms or omit systematic comparisons or in-depth analysis on different methods. To address this issue, we design a comprehensive evaluation framework for hybrid queries. Our study introduces 15 hybrid query algorithms and systematically classifies them based on multiple dimensions, such as index organization and filtering strategy, providing a reference for the categorization of hybrid queries. 

In the experiments, we construct standardized attribute and range sets for attribute filtering and range filtering, respectively, enabling a unified comparison of algorithms in terms of index construction efficiency and query performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of the algorithms across multiple dimensions, including data distributions, platforms, and scalability on a 100-million-scale dataset.
	 Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the experimental results based on the underlying principles of algorithms. Extensive experimental results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Based on the findings, we develop a set of practical guidelines for algorithm selection, offering reliable references for different application scenarios. Furthermore, we identify potential directions for improvement to address the current limitations of these algorithms.}
